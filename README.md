# [Web Demos](https://web-demos-demos-k3wjl72ge-markstanls-projects.vercel.app/)
This website consists of small project demos that I work on. From 3D designs to cool business animations. If I see a cool trend that I wish to try out, the code
for it will end up on this website. This website is built using React + Vite. Most Demos describe what technology was used, if any, and an outline of 
the inspiration, and what I learned. Hosted on Vercel

# Technologies
## TailwindCSS
Tailwind has been my main way to style in this project. Though I am still getting used to a lot of the conventions and best practices, it has been
amazing to work with and I am getting more comfortable with it every project

## React Three Fiber, Drei
The first project I worked on displays React Three Fiber and Drei technologies, which are used to make appealing 3D models come to life. I used it
to make a 3D Island Portfolio with a youtube video I watched, and then applied those skills to make a navbutton on the landing page.

## GSAP
While still trying to understand what motion libraries are most common, I used GSAP to do some interesting landing animations, but more specifically 
used it to make an infinite scroll animation. 

## Spline
I used the Spline React library to make a 3D scene for a camping brand, after seeing it used on a short-form video. I loved the concept so I recreated it.
My entire review of that experience can be seen in the demo



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
